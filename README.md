## Year 4 Project
#### Bayesian Hierarchical Modelling of Helium Signatures in Red Giant Stars

#### Project description:
_Despite being the second most abundant element in the universe, the 
amount of Helium in our galaxy is poorly understood. Large amounts of 
Helium were produced during Big-Bang nucleosynthesis and since then, 
Helium has been enriched by production in stars. But Helium abundances 
in stars are very difficult to measure. This leaves us, so to speak, in 
the dark on helium enrichment - until now._

_With the advent of asteroseismology, we can measure the Helium content 
in the connective envelopes of Red Giant stars. Small signatures of 
Helium can be found as subtle ‘glitches’ in the frequencies of modes of 
oscillation of red giant stars. This project will measure thesesmall 
signatures. Each measure of helium on a star-by-star basis will have 
large, but not too large, uncertainties. For this reason you will 
leverage the power of the ensemble by using thousands of red giant 
stars._

_In order to interpret your star-by-star results, you will construct a 
Bayesian Hierarchical Model which will be applied to thousands of red 
giant stars. This model will produce a new estimate of a Helium Enrichment law as a function of metallicity. With 
this result in the bag, you will explore Helium enrichment, looking for 
new forms of enrichment laws and comparing results to chemical evolution 
models of the galaxy._

_This project contains a number of technically 
challenging methods. To make a success of this project you will need to 
be proficient in statistics and coding - if not at the start of the
project, certainly by the end. Open to any MSci student. Excellent statistical skills and very
string programming skills would be very useful for this project._
