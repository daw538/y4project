### Project HeII - Deliverable 1

___Deadline 14th Dec 2018___

We will produce a working Hierarchical Bayesian Model of Helium II 
glitches in red giants using Stan that can be applied to at least 50 
stars.  We will deliver a short internal report on the performance of 
the model, showing the posteriors for all interesting parameters.  We 
will note and highlight the short comings of the model, and will address 
these in the second semester.
