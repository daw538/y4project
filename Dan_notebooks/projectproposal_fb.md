### Summary of Project Proposal Feedback
___

* Project Overview 
_(Criteria: primary aims; context and motivation;literature review / state of the art)_
The aims and context are a little confused early on but things straighten out inthe later parts of the plan.  The literature review is a little under strength andmore reading would be advisable.  The background detail is at a good level.

* Scientific Context
_(Criteria:   relevant   physics;   understanding;logical development; proposed methods; feasibility; preliminary andexpected results)_
The plan does a good job of describing what is tro be done and givingbackground and technical details bout the work to be done.  Expected resultsare presented byut feel a little confused.

* Project Plan
_(Criteria: clarity; detail; design work; timing; division oflabour; alternatives; deliverables)_
There is plenty of detail on the plan and this is a good thing.  The timelinelooks like an after thought but the design work makes up for this.

* Presentation
_(Criteria: clarity of figures and informative captions;structure and typesetting; grammar and spelling; concise and precisescientific language; narrative; equation formatting; references andcitations)_
Visual presentation is  good.  On the other hand the writing style would benefitfrom some improvement.   Some sections lack clarity and certain paragraphsare very difficult to parse.  Much improvement in the referencing is required. 

#### Suggestions
Good: technical details; background details; good HBM section.Room for improvement: You need to do a better job of referencing.  Take alook at some published papers to get a feel for the level required.  Your writingstyle could be improved.  Prioritising clarityfor the reader and removing ‘fluff’would make an immediate improvement.  On the other hand, building upconcepts more slowly, including more basic steps, would also be desirable. 

___
#### Personal Priorities
1. Clarity of writing style - don't cross reference across paragraphs before the concept has been fully introduced.
2. References!!
3. Read papers to fully gen up on required theory.
