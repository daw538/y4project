## Project initiation document

**Bayesian Hierarchical Modelling of Helium Signatures in Red Giant Stars**

Authors: Joshua Cardrick, Daniel Williams
Supervisor: Dr Guy Davies
Date: Sept 2018 - May 2019

Version History:
V1.0 - Start of project 1/10/2018

#### Background
The overall aim of the project includes the use of statistical techniques including Bayesian Hierarchial Modelling to estimate the nature of the helium enrichment law in stars (if one exists) given a sample population; initially looking at relatively homogeneous groups such as open clusters.

#### Organisation:
Github will be used throughout the project to store files and important communication. This serves as a backup for each computer and allows everyone to access the files. Repository is located [here](https://www.github.com/daw538/y4project).

Communication will primarily occur via email.

#### Deliverables:
* D1 - Project Proposal (to be submitted by 26th October). Minimum length 4 pages plus references.
* D2 - Project work 1
* D3 - Seminar (Spring wks1-2)
