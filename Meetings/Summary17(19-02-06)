Project Mini Meeting - 06/02/19
**************************

- Discussed how to implement reparameterisation of A into stan to improve convergence
	- Rearrange A=A0*exp(-nmax/tau) to find A0 (other variables as free parameters)
	- Don't need A hierarchical initially to work; can be reintroduced later.
- Can test accuracy of GYRE models by computing expected nmax using scaling
  relations from Teff, log_R, log_M etc.
	- Perhaps take models below the RGB bump.
- Remember to start backing up work!

Next meeting: TBC
