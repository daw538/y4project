Project Meeting - 20/03/19
**************************

Discussed starting values for tau: wanders away from appropriate value
May have to settle for the no decay model
Discussed structure of report
no real need for appendices as link to github will suffice
layout not important
Expecting plot for spread of Helium around metallicity relation
Reference Vrard and mention their statement of not being able to find Helium on star by star basis
By using ensemble you actually can
Plots A vs Mass, Temp, Metallicity
Period vs Temp
Next meeting: üôÅ(But possibly skype at some point)
