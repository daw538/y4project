Project Meeting - 10/12/18
**************************

Discussed context of deliverable and project (with seminar in mind)
	- Aims (He abundance and spread)
	- Methods (asteroseismology), leveraging population ensemble

Aims in order to meet deliverable:
	- Load in 50 stars (2D array in stan)
	- Latent (8) parameters
	- Hyperparameters (period and numax/nmax/delta nu):
		period/omega; curvature k; amplitude (as delta nu)
		- See vrard paper table 1
	- extrapolate data they have same length: give them huge uncertainties

Plot period against deltanu for many stars
	- best fit straight line (or power law) used to provide hyperprior

Meeting Music: 'Christmas' noise from outside
Next meeting: 10am Fri 14th December
