Project Meeting - 28/01/19
**************************

Recieved feedback on project seminar (see canvas for notes)
	- Points to note: He abundance in stars tends to fall within 0.24-0.28
	- Waves interfere to produce the individual modes
	- Acyclic graph (aka. probabilistic graphical model)


Discussed problems with HBMs and potential methods to resolve:
	- Introduce a reparameterised variable into model
	- Test without glitch present (output data can be reused in full model)
	- Diagnostic plots:
		* Frequency vs n (tests ν_max, Δν)
		* Residuals of above; set glitch=0 and subtract freq (tests A, G)
		* As above, but against the full model (tests goodness of fit)


Next meeting: 10am Thurs 31st January (Skype)
