Project Meeting - 4/12/18
**************************

Given RG data,
Plot 9 RGs at random,
Plot model and play with ranges to deduce priors,
Plot distribution as output parameters of numax,
Build beginnings of function to set hierarchical priors on model,

Table 1 of Vrard "Asymptotic properties" gives relations to fit to parameters (epsilon = f(dnu), then later, Amplitude)

Use HBM repo:
	- In problem 2 for transformed parameters
	- In problem 3 in HBM repo


Aim to have model:
	-reads in data
	-first guesses
	-priors
	-1 hierarchical element

Next meeting: 3.30 - 5pm Monday 10th December
