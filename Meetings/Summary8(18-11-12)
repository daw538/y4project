- Handed in year review forms
- Ran through both Dan & Josh's HBM models for a (decaying) sine wave
    - Showed how to implement functions in Stan


Aims before next meeting:
- Look at theory to understand how He content relates directly to size of Helium glitch.
- Attempt to reproduce working HBM similar to example demonstrated by Guy in meeting.
    - Be careful with Stan syntax and notation (be consistent with rest of script).
