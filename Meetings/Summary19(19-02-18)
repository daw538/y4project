Project Meeting - 18/02/19
**************************

- Continue to work finessing model
	* Try to reintroduce A as a hierarchical parameter in the model
	* Use plots between parameters (seaborn pairplot); potentially to develop
		hierarchical elements for G and phi. Also posterior of A against metallicity
	* Potentially redefine A as student-t in stan
- Comparison between stellar models and cluster data
	* More models (vary metallicity also)
	* Josh to email Guy for data from clusters
	* Elsworth classification ??
- Begin to consider project conclusion
	* Scripts to automate plot production?
	* Report content and structure (inc daft plots)

Next meeting: Mon 25th (TBC)
