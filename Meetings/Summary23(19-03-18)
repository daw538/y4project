Project Meeting - 18/03/19
**************************

* Discussed recent attempts to improve convergence, since clusters are
  proving difficult (especially NGC6791).
	- Re-initialise As in tau model to be defined using hyperparameters
	  AA and AB found in first model.
	- Develop a power law for phi in dnu to help deal with negative As
	  (red clump stars in data have -ve values which seems to be causing
	  issues).
	- Abandon NGC6791 for now until more important aspects have been
	  dealt with.

* Covered points relating to structure and content of final reports.

Next meeting: Weds 20th Mar 4pm
