Project Meeting - 12/2/19
**************************

Discussed effectiveness of HBM
Models work without decay however this is important to characterisation of glitch
Dan's galactic models and resulting frequencies -> plotted in session (1st and 2nd differences)
Josh create map for period, amplitude, dnu find way to describe initial helium abundance
Starting to analyse results -> determine how results relate to Helium abundance
To Dan's models - introduce metallicity/metal mass fraction Z
See if linear decay works instead of exponential

Next meeting: 3pm Mon 18th Feb
