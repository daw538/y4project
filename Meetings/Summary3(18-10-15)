Project Meeting - 15/10/18
*************************

Most of the meeting was spent going through an example of HBM using PyStan in Jupyter notebook which will be uploaded to GitHub, then Dan and I looked over using Git commands to interface with the repo

Aims for next meeting:
- outline of proposal, could use Overleaf or GitHub (proposal is individual!)
- Potentially divide work into more astro and more statistical for Dan and I
- I need to read up on asteroseismology
- Both need to look into the He glitch
- Look into HBM, use Hogg paper and do some exercises


Next meeting is Mon 22nd at 15:00
