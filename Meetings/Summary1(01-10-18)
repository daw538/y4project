During our first meeting we discussed the following:

  Some background for the measurements and data we will be using:
    amplitude of asteroseismic oscillations as helium signatures
    few thousand stars used to counter uncertainty
    statistically heavy project
  Methodology - Bayesian Hierarchical modelling
    Python (from ground up)
    Stan (PyStan)
    PyMC3
  Some parameters we will be using:
    mass
    temperature
    radius
    metallicity
  Mentioned helium enrichment as a function of metallicity

Before the next session which is set for 3pm on Friday 12th:

Set up GitHub repo
Read 2 of 3 articles provided
Start preparing Project proposal due in week 4
