Project Meeting - 26/11/18
**************************

- Discussed issues relating to estimation of phase parameter (restrict range -2π to 2π and account for the fact the HBM starts on moving in one direction initially in parameter space).
	- Moving the centre point could help
- Fitting the vrard data to our models:
	- Using ν_max ~ 22 may be useful
	- Restrict values of n initially to remove the large 'tail' at lower frequencies


Aims before next meeting:

- Apply Vrard model to our data
	- Curvature? / sine function to account for BCZ
- Look for source of potential bias in estimation of beta in OscillationsHBM
- Keep an eye on the deliverable: organise a second meeting for this week based on progress made.
