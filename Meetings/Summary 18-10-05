Project Meeting - 5/10/18
*************************

Discussed content to go into project proposal (due 26th):
	- Context in research: lack of knowledge about He abundance and impact on other 		parameters (eg fe/h, evolution) stellar evolution etc.
	- Introduction to asteroseismology
	- How does the He glitch arise? (Helium II is ionisation region near the surface of 		the star).
	- Introduction to HBM (use of latent variable techniques).



Get stan/git/python running on laptops (jupyter notebook would be a good method of keeping record of code as a 'lab book').

Read about Bayesian Hierarchical Modelling, using Hogg 2010 paper. Also, read some blog posts / tutorials for understanding.

Next meeting: 15th Oct
